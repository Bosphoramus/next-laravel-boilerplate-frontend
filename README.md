# Next - Laravel boilerplate frontend

This is the frontend for my Next.js - Laravel boilerplate.

It comes with authentication working by default.

This is a fork from [taylorotwell/next-example-frontend](https://github.com/taylorotwell/next-example-frontend), i adjusted it to my likings and added some basic missing features.

As a backend, you can install a fresh copy of Laravel and configure [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum) or clone [the original Taylor's example backend](https://github.com/taylorotwell/next-example-backend).
